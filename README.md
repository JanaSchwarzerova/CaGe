# CaGeApp
Computer-aided approach for Genetic Prediction
Currently advanced sequencing methods have upgraded molecular biology research into so-called post-genomic era. Thus, the research is focused on understanding functional relationships between individual genes causing the final phenotype. This completely new software implemented in Matlab2022b App Designer view has a great potential for opening new paths in understanding predictions tools in genomic prediction challenges.

We developed user-friendly app for uploading genomic (in form single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) and metabolomic data, their visualization and subsequently prediction analysis using different methods such as linear, non-linear and deep learning which is implemented in Matlab2022b.
