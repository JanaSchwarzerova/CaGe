# CaGeApp
Computer-aided approach for Genetic Prediction
This user-friendly app titled CaGa App allows for the uploading of genomics data as form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), metabolomics, and phenotype data. It facilitates data visualization and predictive analysis using various methods, such as linear, non-linear, and deep learning approaches. These analyses include genomic predictions calculated based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, and Random Forest (RF), as well as sophisticated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) with visualization and Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) were all implemented in Matlab2023b.
